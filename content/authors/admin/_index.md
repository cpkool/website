# Short bio (displayed in user profile at end of posts)
bio: I am a political scientist interested in why important actors, like countries and people, behave the way they do toward the environment. My research explores this broad question across different political domains and levels of analysis, from motivating individuals to conserve water, to what makes countries more likely to ratify multi-lateral environmental agreements.
